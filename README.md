# Hoya: HBase on YARN


Hoya is a YARN an application that can deploy HBase cluster on YARN, 
monitor them and make them larger or smaller as desired. Clusters
can be stopped and restarted later.

It is designed to work on Apache Hadoop 2.1, which, until released
with a compatible HBase version, needs some manual intervention
to build locally.
